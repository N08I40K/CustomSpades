# CustomSpades
Custom build of OpenSpades for my server.

# Improvements

The fog is turned off because it pisses me off))
Changed the spread of bullets in weapons.
Added a mini-protection against players trying to log on to the server without this client.
First-person bullet rendering is forcibly enabled

# Why is it even necessary?

Just making the game more convenient for myself and friends.
And protection, so that no one with cheats would come in)))
